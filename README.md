# Cloud-Based Discord Bot
CSC-468 Group 4's discord bot that uses Kubernetes, Jenkins, and a web UI to simplify the Discord moderation process.

Although the cloud-based infrastructure remains incomplete, launching an experiment is still possible. See the Project branch's README for instructions and the profile.
